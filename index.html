            <h2>About Miyazaki</h2>
            <h3>"I'd like more of the world go back to being wild.."</h3>
            <p>Hayao Miyazaki (Miyazaki Hayao, born January 5, 1941) is a Japanese manga artist and prominent film director
                 and animator of many popular anime feature films. Through a career that has spanned nearly five decades, 
                 Miyazaki has attained international acclaim as a maker of animated feature films and, along with Isao Takahata, 
                 co-founded Studio Ghibli, an animation studio and production company. The success of Miyazaki's films has 
                 invited comparisons with American animator Walt Disney, British animator Nick Park as well as Robert Zemeckis, 
                 who pioneered Motion Capture animation, and he has been named one of the most influential people by Time 
                 Magazine..

                 <h2>Howl's Moving Castle<span class="dot">.</span></h2>
                 <p>Studio Ghibli's award-winning animated movie Howl's Moving Castle (2004), loosely based on the critically 
                  acclaimed novel of the same name by Diana Wynne Jones, is a tale of love, loss, the perils of war, and the 
                  value of finding family among friends. The movie centres around a group of mismatched individuals helping each 
                  other through their struggles and creating a home for themselves. The movie's message of love and kindness 
                  resonates with audiences of all ages, making it one of the best films created by Studio Ghibli..</p>

                   <h2>My Neighbour Totoro<span class="dot">.</span></h2>
                   <p>The movie tells the story of two young sisters, Satsuki and Mei Kusakabe. As the story opens, their father is driving 
                     them to their new house, near a vast forest. 
                     This is one of the lovingly hand-crafted works of Hayao Miyazaki, often called the greatest of the Japanese
                     animators, although his colleague at the Ghibli Studios, Isao Takahata, may be his equal. Remarkable that 
                     ''Totoro'' and Takahata's ''Grave of the Fireflies,'' now both in my Great Movies selection, were released 
                     on the same double bill in 1988. Miyazaki has not until very recently used computers to help animate his 
                     films; they are drawn a frame at a time, the classic way, with the master himself contributing tens of 
                     thousands of the frames...

                    <p>The animated film, Spirited Away (Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi), by Hayao Miyazaki is of Japanese origin and
                     was released in the year 2001. The animated film is based on the story of a girl called Chihiro Ogino who is ten
                      years old. As Chihiro and her parents were on their way to a neighborhood, she transitions into a spirit world 
                      alongside her parents. The parents became pigs after Yubaba cast a spell on them. As the only possible way of 
                      freeing her parents and herself from the spiritual bondage, the young girl decides to take a job offer by Yubaba in 
                      the frightening bathhouse. Despite the hurdles she has to overcome alongside her friends, Chihiro succeeds in her 
                      mission of freeing her parents and herself from Yuhaba's spell...
